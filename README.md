# Data-Structure-Code
This repository is a collection of various data structures and random code snippets that I've implemented in C++. It serves as a personal reference and a resource for anyone interested in understanding or using these data structures in their projects.

- Find the how many time number is repeat using doubly linked list - [Code](https://github.com/RadeelAhmad/Data-Structure-Code/blob/main/Double-linked-list.cpp)
- Find numbers with the same digit in tens and units places - [Code](https://github.com/RadeelAhmad/Data-Structure-Code/blob/main/Array1.cpp)
- This code calculates and prints the number of cars needed to accommodate a given number of drivers and passengers, assuming each car holds one driver and up to four passengers - [Code](https://github.com/RadeelAhmad/Data-Structure-Code/blob/main/Code.cpp)
- Search number by indux and number - [Code](https://github.com/RadeelAhmad/Data-Structure-Code/blob/main/Code-1.cpp)
- Function which adds spaces before every capital in a word. Uncapitalize the whole string afterwards - [Code](https://github.com/RadeelAhmad/Data-Structure-Code/blob/main/Code-2.cpp)
- Function that returns the number of characters shared between two words - [Code](https://github.com/RadeelAhmad/Data-Structure-Code/blob/main/Code-3.cpp)
- Function that finds how many prime numbers there are, up to the given integer - [Code](https://github.com/RadeelAhmad/Data-Structure-Code/blob/main/Code-4.cpp)
- function that validates a password to conform to the following rules: -[Code]()
  **1-** Length between 6 and 24 characters.
  **2-** At least one uppercase letter (A-Z).
  **3-** At least one lowercase letter (a-z).
  **4-** At least one digit (0-9).
